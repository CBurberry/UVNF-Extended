This sample project is a re-created copy of the original sample project found at:
https://github.com/Velorexe/UVNF-Unity-Visual-Novel-Framework

This sample project adds a localization example with english and japanese.
Due to the size constraints of the font files, the Japanese font file will need to be imported on your local machine.

Use the NotoSansJP font from Google Fonts along with this tutorial for how to setup the font asset with TMP:

After that, open Window -> Asset Management -> Localization Tables.
Open the table named 'AssetTable' and set the locale-font and locale-font-material with the created TMP assets.
