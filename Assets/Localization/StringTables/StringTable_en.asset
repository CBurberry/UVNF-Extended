    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 6163178914152448
    m_Localized: Welcome to UVNF! I think it's really cool that you decided to give
      this a download.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 6163803987083264
    m_Localized: It took me quite some time to make this whole framework, so I would
      love some feedback on either the GitHub page or to me privately on Discord
      (Velorexe#8403).

    m_Localized: After some dicussion with the artist for this project (Jocelyn Hatch)
      I've decided to release it a bit earlier than I intended to.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 6164837933350912
    m_Localized: This was mostly a decision based on the lack of feedback I was able
      to get from my close surroundings and the motivation I got from seeing multiple
      GitHub users favouriting my project.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 6164885576450048
    m_Localized: So let me give you a little tour of what you can do with this framework
      (for now).
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 6164929356595200
    m_Localized: As you can hear I got some audio dialogue implemented. These can
      do beeps and boops (total ripoff from Animal Crossing, yikes) and normal audio.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 6164970297196544
    m_Localized: Ofcourse you can also use the Dialogue options that don't have audio
      on them for some internal thinking of your character.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 6165012030521344
    m_Localized: Since Characters are very important to any visual novel, I spend
      way too much time implemented a stupid implementation that took way too much
      time where characters "stack" on either side of the screen.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 6165088777895936
    m_Localized: You got quite some options when using this framework to customize
      little things, I hope to expand this further in the future.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 6165162908024832
    m_Localized: Even though it contains a lot of rings and bells, I didn't forget
      about the core features...
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 6165203030736896
    m_Localized: Like choices! Every choice has it's own outcome, which can be connected
      to any node of your choice.

    m_Localized: Vote this to yeet Velorexe off the earth.

    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 6165406626447360
    m_Localized: Option 3
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 6165477820563456
    m_Localized: Or in this case all end in the same end choice.

      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 6165529968345088
    m_Localized: If you want a full list of all the elements you can use, you can
      open the UVNFStoryElements window in the UVNF tab.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 6165562746830848
    m_Localized: If you're really depraved on info, please DM me on Discord (Velorexe#8403,
      still thinking about opening a Discord server). You can also DM me if you want
      custom elements that you think the framework needs.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 6165573962399744
    m_Localized: Anyways, I'm pretty much done explaining right now. So you can see
      how far you'll get before you miss any UVNF Elements.
